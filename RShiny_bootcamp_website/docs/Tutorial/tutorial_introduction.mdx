## Goals
- Understanding use of web applications
- Why we are using R and RShiny


## Our case study
We are going to be following a case study example for our bootcamp. Let’s say we want to better understand and communicate Energy and Environmental Justice issues. Specifically, our goal is to better understand how Energy Burden fluctuates based on different variables.

Energy Burden is defined as “the percentage of gross household income spent on energy costs” (energy.gov).  We not only want to better understand how energy burden fluctuates but also want to expand the community knowledge base. This way our research and exploration are accessible to everyone.

Research papers can be inaccessible to the public, they can be paywalled, hard to understand or even find. Additionally, research by nature is consistently being updated. Therefore, how can we provide one resource that everyone can keep coming back to and is always updated?

**WEB APPLICATIONS!**

## Why are web applications useful?
A web application is an interactive resource that can be easily, shared and updated. A web application allows its users to explore the data at their own pace and pursue their own lines of inquiry. This provides a great opportunity for further community engagement and communication.

A web application aligns well with our goals for greater communication and interaction with the community. This is actually one of the reason the Department of Energy has already created a web application outlining energy burden in the US, its called the <a href='https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/maps/lead-tool'>DOE LEAD tool</a>. We will be modeling our bootcamp tool to mirror some of its capabilities.

## Why are we using R and RShiny
The main issues that plague web application development are **complexity** and **maintainability**. If we make the application extremely complicated then developing the application will take a long time and can be prone to errors. Additionally finding these errors or bugs becomes harder as well. Therefore not only will development process take long and be more intensive, but maintaing and updating it will become an more a challenging task. Many projects are simply abandoned because the developer who created the application leaves the team, and there isn't someone else readily capable of making even simple changes.

Many research teams and faculty are already familiar with the R statistics and coding language. However rarely have the time to learn more coding languages and frameworks, so web application development might seem daunting or impractical. This is where **RShiny** comes into play. RShiny is an R package that lets you easily create and deploy web applications built in R. This lets researchers use their existing coding knowledge and scripts to create their own web applciations. **Now you can easily integrate the same code that you use to create graphs for research papers for your own web applications.**
