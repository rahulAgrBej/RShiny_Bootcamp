## Goals
- Explore our case study
- Outline our inputs needs
- Outline our output expectations


## Our Case study
We are looking to explore and better understand how energy burden fluctuates in the US. For this we will be duplicating some of the functionality of the <a href='https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/maps/lead-tool'>DOE LEAD tool</a>. Take a few moments to explore this tool. We will be duplicating the bar chart visualizations on the website (seen below).

At its most basic level our web application will showcase how energy fluctuates based on different inputs:
- % income above Federal Poverty Level
- Building Age
- Heating Fuel
- Building Type
- Renting/Owning

## Our Input needs
We call the parts of our web application that the user sees and interacts with the **UI (User Interface)**. We will want to let our users choose which variables/lens to explore energy burden. So one part of our UI will consist of some sort of selection, lets decide it will be through a dropdown menu.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/user_to_dropdown_UI.svg')}/>

## Our Output expectations
We call the parts of our web application that access our data and perform the underlying calculations, like filtering data and creating graphs, our **backend or server-side code**. In our case our web application will search our database based on the user inputed variable (ie. Federal Poverty Level) ....

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dropdown_to_server.svg')}/>

... create a graph and return it to the UI to display to the user.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/server_to_ui_graph.svg')}/>

Now we a structure that meets our web application goals. It allows our users to interact and choose a lens/variable to view energy burden and returns a graph visualizing this information for them.
